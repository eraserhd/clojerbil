clojerbil
=========

Clojerbil is a deliberately thin and deliberately terrible implementation of
Clojure on top of Gerbil Scheme.  Its intent is to add Clojure-type niceties on
top of Gerbil and allow simple Clojure code to work without making a complicated
compatibility layer.

* No special reader is implemented, it's just a library.
* Immutable data structures will be implemented naively (and mayactually be
  Gerbil's mutable structures), at least until someone has time and interest in
  improving them.

Implemented
-----------

* `true`, `false`, and `nil` are aliases for `#t`, `#f`, and `()`

Macros:

* `->`
* `if-let`
* `when-let`

Functions:

* `count`
* `dec`
* `get`
* `get-in`
* `inc`

Example
-------

[code,scheme]
----
(import :clojerbil/core)

(if-let [x true]
  (displayln x))
